  <p>
    As a lifelong learner and adventure seeker, I enjoy taking on big challenges, 
    honing new skills, and experiencing different parts of the world.
  </p>

  <p>
    I've biked 4,000 miles across the United States in 2.5 months. 
    I've taught English overseas in South Korea. And I've taught myself how to 
    program while building a multivendor marketplace and event management system 
    for the sport of baton twirling.

    Outside of my work as a designer, developer, and entrepreneur, I enjoy cooking, running,
    cycling, painting, and learning foreign languages (my current Duolingo streak is 1045 days and counting!).
