- Designed and developed a scaffolded programming practice interface (CodeMirror/VueJS) where learners can solve problems using block-based or custom-written code and receive unit test feedback. The result is a learning experience that supports learners at a variety of skill levels and maximizes agency/autonomy.
- Conceptualized, designed, and developed clickstream analytics tools to understand learner behavior during the problem solving process, creating the ability replay and compare learner choices for research (Django).
- Analyzed competitors (Qualtrics and Google Forms) and built custom survey authoring, completion, and result display functionality (e.g. single, multiple, or free response, response validation and limits, etc) (Django/VueJS).
- Implemented e-book authoring functionality that supports a variety of page content (text, rich media, surveys, problems, and questions). Authors can also apply/manage time limits for a given page/learner to ensure sound research design.
- Adhered to Test Driven Development best practices while building role-based permissions for API endpoints and modular business logic functions. Configured GitHub Actions to automatically run unit tests at key deployment pipeline stages.
