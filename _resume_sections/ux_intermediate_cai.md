- Teamed up with learning experience designers to **identify feature gaps** in Coursera and edX, **generate and prioritize ideas** to fill those gaps with LTI (learning tools interoperability) plug-ins, and collect design feedback on prototypes, leading to a suite of tools now used by thousands of learners on Coursera and edX.

- **Defined the brand identity and UI style guide** for Michigan Online, specifying color palette, typography, illustration characteristics, and interface component styles such as form elements, menus, and cards.

- **Collaborated with a backend developer** to translate Michigan Online designs into technical requirements. Personally handled the HTML and Jinja templating, SCSS, and JavaScript development.

- Worked closely with a student fellowship coordinator to **create a fun, enriching, inclusive experience** for student employees, including an end-of-summer campus-wide scavenger hunt and team bonding retreat.
