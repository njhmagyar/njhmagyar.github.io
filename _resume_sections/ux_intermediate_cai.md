- **Identified feature gaps** in Coursera and edX with learning experience designers and iteratively designed LTl (learning tools interoperability) plug-ins to address pedagogical needs. The result was Gamut, a suite of tools with a cohesive brand now used by thousands of learners on Coursera and edX.

- **Defined the brand identity and UI style guide** for Michigan Online, specifying color palette, typography, illustration characteristics, and interface component styles such as form elements, menus, and cards.

- **Collaborated with a backend developer** to translate Michigan Online designs into technical requirements. Personally handled the HTML and Jinja templating, SCSS, and JavaScript development.

- Worked closely with a student fellowship coordinator to **create a fun, enriching, inclusive experience for student employees,** including an end-of-summer campus-wide scavenger hunt and team bonding retreat.
