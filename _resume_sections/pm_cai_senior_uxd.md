- **Conducted focus groups** with university students and **assembled click-by-click prototypes** for Michigan Online, the University of Michiganâ€™s online learning experience catalog. As of October 2024, the platform contains over 300 learning experiences and more than 200,000 people have created accounts.

- **Ran usability tests** with 10 Michigan Online learners from 8 different countries to determine the optimal layout of the course detail page and preferred information hierarchy for course metadata.

- **Explored numerous interaction options with creativity and curiosity** to resolve a complex Michigan Online UX challenge: most courses are available on multiple platforms (Coursera, edX, or Future Learn). The course detail page needed to communicate these options and the differences between them in a compact but complete way before ultimately directing the user to their desired platform. The final solution was a modal that displayed the options and outbound links, as well as a separate page that explained key platform differences.
