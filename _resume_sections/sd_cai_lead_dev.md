- Leads an interdisciplinary team of designers, developers, and behavioral scientists on Spire (Rails/VueJS), a competency-based learning web application platform that spans 3 University of Michigan schools/colleges and thousands of students, and GradeCraft (Rails/VueJS), a gameful learning management system used by over 500 K-12 and higher education courses in 2024.
- Supervises 4 junior- and senior-level software developers, providing bi-annual performance reviews and professional development guidance.
- Defined promotion criteria for the software developer career pathway at the organization, supported by developer-specific competencies.
- Coordinates with organizational leadership to define and achieve key performance indicators for the organization and assigned projects.
- Steers feature development work through all phases of the product life cycle, from conceptualization and research, to design and usability testing, to development, analysis, and iteration.
- Collaborated with fellow developers to migrate a learning management system from LTI (learning tools interoperability) 1.1 to 1.3, requiring new knowledge of LTI/OpenID Connect authentication to design new database models and multi-step backend functions for handling both new and existing LTI users.
- Partners with UX Designers to translate designs into development requirements and distribute implementation responsibilities.
- Writes custom data seed scripts to populate a production database with relational content (Ruby).
- Uses non-persisted model classes (Rails) to aggregate and serialize complex data to minimize database queries and maximize page loading performance (e.g., a CareerProgress class that computes a user's status towards completing a career's requirements based on deeply nested related models).
- Leads a longstanding effort to migrate Angular 1 code to VueJS, avoiding regressions by thoroughly documenting and planning each page's transition and focusing on 1:1 functional compatibility, rather than trying to also expand/modify features while migrating them.
