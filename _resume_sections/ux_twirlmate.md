- Designed the first ever multi-vendor marketplace to manage competitive baton twirling events. In October 2024, I piloted the system with 109 users who generated $15,646 in registration fees via custom Stripe Checkout.
- Produced pixel-perfect illustrations for web, social media, and email marketing.
- Surveyed 39 baton twirling community members on their win-tracking habits and preferences to inform new feature designs.
- Developed a flexible, cohesive design system that is modular, extensible, beautiful, and accessible using atomic Figma components and styles.
- Prototyped, tested, and iterated on a role-specific multi-step onboarding flow to streamline initial data entry and wayfinding.
- Defined personas to represent target users' domain knowledge, tech savviness, and demographic characteristics during feature design work.
