- **Translated broad concepts** for a baton twirling competition management system into concrete designs. In October 2024, I piloted the system with 97 users who generated $16,155 in registration fees.

- Surveyed 39 baton twirling community members on their win-tracking habits and preferences, then **performed quantitative and qualitative analyses** to inform narrow feature design decisions.

- Defined a **flexible, cohesive, and accessible design system** using atomic Figma components and styles.

- Identified opportunities to **insert fun and delight into the user experience.** For example, detailed illustrations and a spinning baton loading indicator that appears whenever a user submits a form.
