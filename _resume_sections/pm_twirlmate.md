- Owned the entire product lifecycle of a multi-vendor marketplace: from concept, to design and implementation, to analysis and revision. The system is currently being piloted by a contest taking place in Ohio, October 2024, with over 100 contestants.
- Performed quantitative and qualitative analysis on 39 responses to a survey on baton twirling community members' win-tracking habits and preferences, ultimately informing new feature design decisions.
- Iteratively designed and tested a linear flow for planning a baton twirling competition, conducting 10 usability tests and incorporating findings along the way. The outcome was a simple, intuitive user experience that adapted to the kind of event the user was creating.
- Identified opportunities to insert fun and delight into the user experience through animation, the best example being a loading indicator of a spinning baton that appears whenever a user submits a form.
