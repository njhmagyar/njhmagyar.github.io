- Owned the entire product lifecycle of the first ever multi-vendor marketplace for the sport of baton twirling: from concept, to design and implementation, to analysis and revision. In October 2024, I completed a pilot of the system with 109 users who generated $15,646 in registration fees.
- Surveyed 39 baton twirling community members on their win-tracking habits and preferences, then performed quantitative and qualitative analysis on their responses to inform new feature design decisions.
- Iteratively designed and tested a linear flow for planning a baton twirling competition, conducting 10 usability tests and incorporating findings along the way. The outcome was a simple, intuitive user experience that adapted to the kind of event the user was creating.
- Identified opportunities to insert fun and delight into the user experience through animation. For example, a spinning baton loading indicator that appears whenever a user submits a form.
