tagline: 'I redesigned a mobile registration experience, transforming a disjointed onboarding flow into a seamless customer journey; achieving a usability score of 89 (well above the industry average of 67) and reducing average time between sign up and checkout from 8 to 5 minutes.'
overview: 'Multi-step registration flows often fail when they assume users will complete steps in a "logical" order. In this case, a contest registration platform required account setup before registration. But users arrived with one goal: register for a specific event. This mismatch between system design and user intent caused confusion, abandonment, and required manual intervention to complete registrations. <br><br>I redesigned the mobile registration experience, transforming a disjointed onboarding flow into a seamless customer journey; achieving a usability score of 89 (well above the industry average of 67) and reducing average time between sign up and checkout from 8 to 5 minutes.'

    <h2 data-sidebar class="mb-0">Assumptions â‰  Reality</h2>
    <p>
      The platform assumed users would create accounts first, then register for events later. So when users arrived with immediate intent to register for a specific contest, there was a 4-click gap between the end of the onboarding flow and the desired registration page.

  <h2 data-sidebar class="mb-0">Real users, real revenue loss</h2>
  <p>As founder managing support, I saw the problem firsthand:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><p class="my-0"><strong>Customers:</strong> frustrated with the system architecture</p></li>
    <li><p class="my-0"><strong>Directors:</strong> concerned about fewer attendees and lost revenue</p></li>
    <li><p class="my-0"><strong>My business:</strong> increased customer support and manual registration effort</p></li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="responsive-margin-bottom">
  <h2 data-sidebar class="mb-0">Best UX over quick wins</h2>
  <p>I explored 3 solutions to the problem:</p>
  <p><strong>Option 1: Post-Setup Redirection</strong> - After account creation, redirect users to find their contest again on the event list page.</p>
  <p><strong>Option 2: Context Preservation</strong> - Use technical parameters to remember which contest users were registering for and redirect them after account setup.</p>
  <p><strong>Option 3: Contextual Account Creation</strong> - Embed account setup directly within the registration process.</p>
  <p>I ultimately went with option 3 because it provided the best user experience and would deliver the highest long term value.</p>

<div class="responsive-margin-bottom">
  <h2 data-sidebar class="mb-0">62.5% faster completion</h2>
  <p class="">Usability testing with 5 target users showed task completion time dropped from 8 minutes to 3 minutes (62.5% reduction). Mobile usability scores jumped from "marginally acceptable" (SUS: 67) to "excellent" (SUS: 89). Users completed the flow without confusion or manual intervention.</p>
