    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p class="p--lg">
      The current authoring interface allowed for fine-grained control over all aspects of a practice problem. But, creating each problem by hand took up to 20 minutesâ€”way too long!
    </p>

  <div>
    <h2>The Goal</h2>
    <p class="p--lg">I wanted to explore: how might Codespec enhance the content creation workflow with GenAI while continuing to leverage instructor expertise for pedagogical quality?</p>
  </div>

  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>The Impact</h2>
    <p class="p--lg">
      In just 6 hours, I used Claude Code to go from a concept to a polished prototype that looked and felt like the production website.</p>
    <p class="p--lg">
      Instead of spending 16+ hours creating a design system and component library in Figma, making pixel-perfect adjustments and responsive behavior improvements in design mode, and wiring screens together for the prototype, I used prompt engineering techniques to achieve the user journey and interaction patterns I envisioned.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<h2 class="align--center responsive-margin-bottom">How I Made It Happen</h2>

<div class="responsive-margin-bottom">
  <h2>Define Personas</h2>
  <p class="p--lg">
    I started by defining my target users: computer science educators and researchers struggling to generate
    high-quality practice problems due to limited time or knowledge.
  </p>
  <p class="p--lg">
    Despite differences in programming experience, both personas are open to using new tools and would like to maximize output while minimizing time investment.

  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>Human-in-the-loop Planning</h2>
    <p class="p--lg">
      Before prototyping, I considered which attributes of programming problems instructors might want instant control over to ensure high quality output.
    </p>
    <p class="p--lg">
      I also identified aspects that AI could take a first pass at before handing them back to a human to review
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="mb-3">
  <div>
    <h2>User Journey Mapping</h2>
    <p class="p--lg">
      Then, I determined the order for collecting, generating, and reviewing the above attributes.
      The workflow needed to balance AI efficiency with human oversight at each step:

  <div>
    <h2>Wireframe Sketching</h2>
    <p class="p--lg">
      With this flow in mind, I sketched out each screen. I imagined a linear wizard-like experience, where
      each step focused on a few key pieces about the problem.
    </p>
    <p class="p--lg">
      I wanted the interface to feel approachable and clean, so authors could focus on the content rather than trying understand how to use the system.

    <h2>Iterative Protoyping with Claude Code</h2>
    <p class="p--lg">
      I collaborated with Claude in small, specific, example-rich steps to bring the design to life.
    </p>
    <p class="p--lg">I stated my end goal up front, but emphasized the importance of working incrementally:</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="nhm-wrapper responsive-margin-bottom">
  <p class="p--lg">
    "Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I want to prototype a wizard flow
    for authoring programming practice problems with GenAI. The interface should look and feel like Codespec's
    production website (https://www.codespec.org). Let's create the prototype step by step.
  </p>
  <p class="p--lg">
    Start by retrieving Codespec's stylesheet and JavaScript files, and saving them to a folder on my computer. Link to them from an index.html file in the same folder. You can create boilerplate HTML structure (head, body, main) but nothing else yet."

  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>Debugging Claude's Output</h2>
    <p class="p--lg">
      Most of Claude's output was readily usable, but as I tested it I found a few things that needed adjustment.
    </p>
    <p class="p--lg">
      For example, Claude gave all links href values of "#"" by default, which created unexpected behavior when you clicked on them. I needed to find a way to "deactivate" elements I didn't need to be clickable in the prototype.
    </p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>Communicating System Status</h2>
    <p class="p--lg">
      As the steps of the authoring flow came together, I wanted to signal to the user when Codespec and ChatGPT were "thinking" (e.g., creating the instructions, solution, tests, etc).
    </p>
    <p class="p--lg">
      I did so visually and verbally, by animating the Codespec logo and displaying brief, clear text about what was happening.
    </p>
  </div>

    </div>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>Signaling Interactivity</h2>
    <p class="p--lg">
      Since this prototype was for demonstration purposes only (not usability testing), I wanted to help users
      navigate its limited functionality. I understand that portfolio reviewers have a limited amount of time, so it was important to help them experience the demo as quickly and easily as possible.
    </p>
    <p class="p--lg">
      I asked Claude to apply a gentle "pulsing" box shadow to a specific set of inputs and buttons that facilitated the interaction flow.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<h2 class="align--center">The Result</h2>

  <h2>Key Takeaway</h2>
  <p class="p--lg">
    GenAI thrives on specificity and examples.
  </p>
  <p class="p--lg">
    I was able to assemble a hyper-realistic prototype 62% faster because I provided Claude with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript directly from Codespec's production website. After establishing a strong foundational design system with Claude, I worked effectively in small, incremental steps to bring the experience I imagined to life.
