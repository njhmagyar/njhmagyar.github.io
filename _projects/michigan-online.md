  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p class="p--lg">
      Course pages lacked sufficient detail when it came to displaying rating and review information.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <p class="p--lg">
      A well-designed review section contributes to an organization/product's overall <strong>reputation</strong>, and increases consumer <strong>trust</strong> in the quality of their purchase. Visibility into the full array of reviews (not just the most positive ones) also improves the <strong>credibility</strong> of reviews.
    </p>

  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>The Goals</h2>
    <p class="p--lg">
      To address this challenge, I needed to:
    </p>
    <ol class="pl-2">
      <li class="p--lg">
        <p class="p--lg">
          Provide a fuller picture of the range of ratings
        </p>
      </li>
      <li class="p--lg">
        <p class="p--lg">
          Make reviews more browsable
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </div>
</div>

<h2 class="align--center responsive-margin-bottom">How I Made It Happen</h2>

<div class="responsive-margin-bottom">
  <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
  <p class="p--lg">
    I first examined how three other online learning sites present ratings and reviews for their content:
  </p> 
  <img src="/assets/images/michigan-online/michigan-online--coursera.png" class="d-block w-100 mb-3" alt="" />
  <img src="/assets/images/michigan-online/michigan-online--udemy.png" class="d-block w-100 mb-3" alt="" />
  <img src="/assets/images/michigan-online/michigan-online--skillshare.png" class="d-block w-100 mb-3" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="responsive-margin-bottom">
  <h2>Prototyping</h2>
  <p class="p--lg">
    I then explored two approaches: one that kept all rating and review information on the main course page, and one that separated the exploration experience into two pages (offering surface-level information on the main page and a list of full reviews on a different page).
  </p>
  <p class="p--lg">
    The first design minimized clicks but increased scrolling on the page as a whole. The second design provided a more progressive exploration of the reviews, but obscured the full set of reviews behind an additional click that some users might miss.
  </p>

  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
    <p class="p--lg">
      After that, I conducted 5 usability tests with undergraduate students who were experienced with online learning. Findings included:
    </p> 
  </div>
</div>

<div class="responsive-margin-bottom">
<ul>
  <li>
    <p class="p--lg">
      Participants were okay with going to a second page to see all reviews, as it made the main course page less overwhelming.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p class="p--lg">
      Participants were sometimes unaware that the histogram and star ratings were interactive. One person also suggested displaying the percentage of total ratings each level represented.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p class="p--lg">
      Some participants expressed interest in knowing more about the people who wrote reviews, in order to determine if the feedback was coming from a person similar to them.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

    <img src="/assets/images/michigan-online/michigan-online--ideal-version.png" class="nhm-card__image object-fit--contain" alt="" />
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>Final Iteration</h2>
    <p class="p--lg">
      In the last iteration of the project, I incorporated user feedback to better communicate each rating's interactivity and proportion.
    </p> 
    <h3>Unexpected Constraint</h3>
    <p class="p--lg">
      I experimented with adding more biographical information about each reviewer, but due to data limitaitons I was unable to provide these details. We source our reviews from 3rd party platforms who don't pass that info to us (e.g., Coursera).
    </p> 
  </div>
</div>

<div class="responsive-margin-bottom align--center">
  <div>
    <h2>The Result</h2>
    <p class="p--lg align--left">
    The outcome of this effort was a more interactive, transparent course rating section that allowed prospective learners to explore the full set of reviews for a given learning experience.
    </p>
    <p class="p--lg align--left">
    Now that the design is implemented, I'd like to collect quantitative measurements of user satisfaction, and monitor click-through rates between the course and review pages to guage usage.
