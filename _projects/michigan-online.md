    Michigan Online is your destination for global, lifelong, and engaged learning with the University of Michigan.

    <img src="/assets/images/michigan-online/michigan-online--problem.png" class="nhm-card__image" alt="" />
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p class="p--lg">
      Course pages lacked sufficient detail when it came to displaying rating and review information.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="nhm-card--horizontal image-last--mobile responsive-margin-bottom">
  <div class="nhm-card__image-wrapper">
    <img src="/assets/images/michigan-online/michigan-online--after.gif" class="nhm-card__image" alt="" />
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>The Goals</h2>
    <p class="p--lg">
      To address this challenge, I needed to:
    </p>
    <ol class="pl-2">
      <li class="p--lg">
        <p class="p--lg">
          Provide a fuller picture of the range of ratings
        </p>
      </li>
      <li class="p--lg">
        <p class="p--lg">
          Make reviews more browsable
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </div>
</div>

<h2 class="align--center responsive-margin-bottom">How I Made It Happen</h2>

<div class="responsive-margin-bottom">
  <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
  <p class="p--lg">
    I first examined how three other online learning sites present ratings and reviews for their content:
  </p> 
  <img src="/assets/images/michigan-online/michigan-online--coursera.png" class="d-block w-100 mb-3" alt="" />
  <img src="/assets/images/michigan-online/michigan-online--udemy.png" class="d-block w-100 mb-3" alt="" />
  <img src="/assets/images/michigan-online/michigan-online--skillshare.png" class="d-block w-100 mb-3" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="nhm-card--horizontal image-last--mobile responsive-margin-bottom">
  <div class="nhm-card__image-wrapper">
    <img src="/assets/images/construction.svg" class="mxh-300 nhm-card__image" alt="" />
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>Prototyping</h2>
    <p class="p--lg">
      I then explored two approaches: one that kept all rating and review information on the main course page, and one that separated the exploration experience into two pages (offering surface level information on the main page and a list of full reviews on a different page).
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="nhm-card__image-wrapper">
    <img src="/assets/images/construction.svg" class="mxh-300 nhm-card__image" alt="" />
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
    <p class="p--lg">
      After that, I conducted 5 usability tests with undergraduate students who were experienced with online learning. Findings included:
    </p> 
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p class="p--lg">
          Participants were often most interested in seeing the reviews associated with the lowest ratings. “Why didn’t someone like this course?”
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="p--lg">
          Participants were okay with going to a second page to see all reviews, as it made the main course page less overwhelming.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="p--lg">
          Some participants expressed interest in knowing more about the people who wrote reviews, and being able to see more descriptive rating/review information about the course (similar to Skillshare).
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="nhm-card--horizontal image-last--mobile responsive-margin-bottom">
  <div class="nhm-card__image-wrapper">
    <img src="/assets/images/construction.svg" class="mxh-300 nhm-card__image" alt="" />
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>Final Iteration</h2>
    <p class="p--lg">
      Ultimately, I went with the version that splits the experience into two pages, one for seeing a subset of the most recent reviews by rating level on the main course page and another for seeing all reviews.
