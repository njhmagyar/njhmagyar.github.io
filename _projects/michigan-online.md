  <h2 data-sidebar>Incomplete rating info</h2>
  <p class="">
    Course pages lacked sufficient detail when it came to displaying rating and review information.
  </p>

<div class="responsive-margin-bottom">
  <h2 data-sidebar>Consumer trust is key</h2>
  <p class="">
    Why was this a problem? A well-designed review section contributes to an organization/product's overall <strong>reputation</strong>, and increases consumer <strong>trust</strong> in the quality of their purchase. Visibility into the full array of reviews (not just the most positive ones) also improves the <strong>credibility</strong> of reviews.
  </p>

<div class="responsive-margin-bottom">
  <h2 data-sidebar>Competitor inspiration</h2>
  <p class="">
    To inform my design process, I first examined how three other online learning sites present ratings and reviews for their content:
  </p> 
  <div class="nhm-card-grid three-columns">
    <img src="/assets/images/michigan-online/michigan-online--coursera.png" class="nhm-card-grid__item w-100" alt="" />
    <img src="/assets/images/michigan-online/michigan-online--udemy.png" class="nhm-card-grid__item w-100" alt="" />
    <img src="/assets/images/michigan-online/michigan-online--skillshare.png" class="nhm-card-grid__item w-100" alt="" />
  </div>
</div>

<div class="responsive-margin-bottom">
  <h2 data-sidebar>Hi-fi solution exploration</h2>
  <p class="">
    I then explored two approaches: one that kept all rating and review information on the main course page, and one that separated the exploration experience into two pages (offering surface-level information on the main page and a list of full reviews on a different page).
  </p>
  <p class="">
    The first design minimized clicks but increased scrolling on the page as a whole. The second design provided a more progressive exploration of the reviews, but obscured the full set of reviews behind an additional click that some users might miss.

<div class="responsive-margin-bottom">
  <h3>A/B Usability Testing</h3>
  <p class="">
    After that, I conducted 5 usability tests with undergraduate students who were experienced with online learning.
  </p>

<div class="responsive-margin-bottom ">
  <h2 data-sidebar>Increased transparency</h2>
  <p>
  The outcome of this effort was a more interactive, transparent course rating section that allowed prospective learners to explore the full set of reviews for a given learning experience.
  </p>
  <p>
  Now that the design is implemented, I'd like to collect quantitative measurements of user satisfaction, and monitor click-through rates between the course and review pages to guage usage.
