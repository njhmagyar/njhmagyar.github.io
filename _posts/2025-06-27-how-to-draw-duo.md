Did you know all Duolingo characters are made of three basic shapes? Rounded rectangles, half circles, and rounded triangles! This not only makes them super easy to draw, but also underscores the company's commitment to simplicity at all levels of the product. 

After reading through [Duolingo's brand and design guidelines](https://design.duolingo.com/), I was inspired to teach others how to draw Duo himself!

If you'd like to follow along, feel free to download the guide:

## Step 1: Create basic shapes

Duolingo encourages designers to create simple graphics with dynamic proportions. Using as few shapes as possible keeps the final result clean and makes animators' lives easier.

## Step 2: Round the corners

A hallmark of Duolingo design, rounded corners convey a
friendly, warm, youthful feeling to viewers.

## Step 3: Add final details

Without overdoing it, Duolingo adds detail to each illustration.
This may come in the form of floating feet, a soft shadow, or more nuanced shapes.

## Step 4: Put it <span style="color:#78c93d;">owl</span> together

Having practiced drawing each element separately, you're now ready to combine them all! And while you're at it, throw some color in there.
