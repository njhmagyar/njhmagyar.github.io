People form impressions in a matter of seconds. So
how your portfolio **looks** matters just as much--if not more--than
what your portfolio **says**.

That's why I took a fresh pass at the self-portraits used on each page.

## Where I Started

The previous images were professional, warm, and friendly, but the facial expressions and postures of the figures lacked differentiation, personality and visual intrigue.

## Desired Style

In addition to remaining professional, warm and friendly, I wanted to instantly convey to viewers that I'm a designer with:
- a playful style

- energy

- strong artistic ability and attention to detail

## Iteration 1

For the first iteration, I drew inspiration from reference images to explore a whimsical line-based, dual-chromatic style. While it achieved a playful look, I felt too limited in how detailed I could make the facial expressions.

## Iteration 2

During a second iteration, I reviewed Duolingo's design recommendations, which helped me understand how to create more a lively character with engaging postures.

## Final Details

Satisfied with the new playful style, I selected which postures to use for each page and crafted smaller supporting graphics to underscore the theme of each page (e.g., home, about, illustrations, etc).
