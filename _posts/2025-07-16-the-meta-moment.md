ðŸ¤¯ Plot twist: I just experienced the perfect prompt engineering lesson... while learning prompt engineering.

## Here's What Happened

Step 1: I asked Claude for prompt engineering advice<br> 
Step 2: Got 7 solid techniques<br>
Step 3: Felt overwhelmed (sound familiar?)<br>
Step 4: Asked for help making it manageable<br>
Step 5: Realized I was DOING the thing I was learning<br>

## The Meta Moment
My follow-up request was textbook prompt engineering...

âœ… Context: "I'm feeling overwhelmed." <br> 
âœ… Clear constraint: "This is a lot to remember." <br> 
âœ… Specific: "Give me the 3 most impactful things I can do..." <br> 
âœ… Iteration: "from your original suggestions."<br> 

## The Real Lesson

Start with the "Big Three" habits...

<ol class="pl-1">
  <li><p class="my-0">Be laser-specific (biggest immediate impact)</p></li>
  <li><p class="my-0">Use examples (easiest to remember)</p></li>
  <li><p class="my-0">Iterate, don't restart (saves time, builds on what works)</p></li>
</ol>

Master these three first. Then add others gradually.

## The Irony
I learned more about good prompting from my second question to Claude than my first. 

Sometimes the best way to understand a concept is to accidentally demonstrate it. The student became the... well, slightly better student. ðŸ˜…
